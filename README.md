# Overview

### Purpose

Pewlett-Hackard is preparing for expected retirements for a large group of employees that will be reaching the retirement age. Senior management requires carefully presented retirement-age information in order to adequately prepare for what is expected to be a large number of employees leaving in the next few years. 
With the available employee information that includes birth-dates, as well as start and end-dates of employment, and with other related information, data tables were created for management to help with planning and decisions.

### Description

Pewlett-Hackard, also known as "P-H", is upgrading its employee database structure, and will using SQL as the database query language. The relational database will be set up on PostgreSQL, and using pgAdmin as the user interface access system. 

This project is assisting Bobby in building the new employee SQL compatible database, and utilizing applications of data modeling, data engineering and data analysis. The project focus is on employees and preparation planning for retirement scenarios. 

For the data modeling, the below Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), was prepared using the information in the provided six csv files. The ERD aided the process of constructing the needed SQL instructions and queries. 
 

| Data csv Files | Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) |
| :---         |     :---:      |
| departments.csv, dept_emp.csv, dept_manager.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, titles.csv |    ![Employee2DB.png](https://github.com/larrydodson/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/master/Employee2DB.png)     |


The ERD flowchart highlights the type of information contained within data tables and the relationships to each other. The ERD tool also includes the following from each CSV file:
  - Primary keys
  - Foreign keys
  - Data types for each column



### Resources

- Data sources: departments.csv, dept_emp.csv, dept_manager.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, titles.csv
- Software: Python 3.8.3, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook, Windows10, PostgreSQL 12, pgAdmin4 4.24
- Tools: Quick Database Diagrams ("Quick DBD")

# Summary

Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
(addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight) 

### Two Questions and Replies - 
  1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
  
  
  
  2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
